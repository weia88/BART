        <p>During this task you will wear the headphones. However, do not put them on yet. </p>
        <p>Throughout this task, you will be presented with 30 balloons, one at a time.
          For each balloon you will press the button to pump up the balloon as much as you
          would like. In the game, you will accumulate 1 cent in a temporary bank for each pump.
          It is your choice to determine how much to pump up the balloon, but be aware that
          at some point the balloon will explode. </p>
        <p>The explosion point varie across balloons, ranging from the first pump to
          enough pumps to make the balloon fill the entire computer screen.
          If the balloon explodes before cashing out, you do not receive any money for that balloon.
          If your balloon does not explode, the money you earned in your temporary bank
          is transferred into your permanent bank in the game. </p>
        <p>The goal is to earn as much money in the game as possible.
          When you are finished, please let me know. </P>
        <p>Please click the button labeled “Press to Continue” and put your headphones on. Be sure not to press any buttons on the headphone or adjust the volume.”</p>
